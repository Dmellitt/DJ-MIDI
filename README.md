What we made for Project 01 is a music generator and player out of an Arduino Uno.  

It has five different modes:  three of these modes play the preprogrammed songs, which are The Legend of Zelda Great Fairy's Fountain Theme, The Super Mario Bros Underwater Theme, and the Kingdom Hearts Title Theme.  The other two modes generate user customizable music, with the first mode being where you can choose between specific frequenices, and the other where there is a continuous frequency range you can manipulate, causing for a more fluid sound. 

This project fits into video game history because the music of video games was very humble in its origins.  The tones generated to go alongside classic games often were very simple because the consoles that the games were played on could only handle so much.  When video games emerged as an up and coming form of popular entertainment, music was stored on heavy hardware components.  This caused for in depth and heavily varied music to be nearly impossible to produce on the consoles of the day and age.  Instead, a cheaper and more reasonable means of providing musical accompaniment or sound effects to the games was to use digital means, where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on the fly for output on a speaker.  These sounds were often monophonic, looped and were used sparingly.

Our project displays examples of these sounds: we picked the frequencies that would best generate sounds to emulate these classic songs, as well as allowed for a user interactive capability.
